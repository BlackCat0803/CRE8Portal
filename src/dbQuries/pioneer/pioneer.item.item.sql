 1.0  Using the Principles of Geometric Dilution, mix Anastrozole, Food Color Powder and Microcrystalline Cellulose (PH-105) together with trituration in a mortar and pestle. par
par
 2.0  Triturations should have powders where the particle size is the same throughout.  Once powders are thoroughly mixed, sieve through an 80 mesh sieve (PCCA #35-3125) to ensure even particle size.     Do not force large particles through the sieve as this destroys the integrity of the sieve.  Instead, any particles remaining in the sieve should be triturated in mortar and pestle to reduce particle size, and ALL powders should be sieved again.par

WARNING! SAFETY WHEN COMPOUNDING: Precautions should be taken when compounding hormone and other steroids, as they can be absorbed through skin, mucous membranes and lungs.  Wear appropriate lab apparel, eye protection and respirator.  Use an appropriate filter system to reduce the amount of airborne chemical particles in your lab.  Monitor to ensure there is no direct exposure to the compounder.  par

 1.0  Using the Principles of Geometric Dilution, mix Liothyronine and Microcrystalline Cellulose (PH-105) together with trituration in a mortar and pestle. par
par
 2.0  Triturations should have powders where the particle size is the same throughout.  Once powders are thoroughly mixed, sieve through an 80 mesh sieve to ensure even particle size.     Do not force large particles through the sieve as this destroys the integrity of the sieve.  Instead, any particles remaining in the sieve should be triturated in mortar and pestle to reduce particle size, and ALL powders should be sieved again.par

WARNING! SAFETY WHEN COMPOUNDING: Precautions should be taken when compounding hormone and other steroids, as they can be absorbed through skin, mucous membranes and lungs.  Wear appropriate lab apparel, eye protection and respirator.  Use an appropriate filter system to reduce the amount of airborne chemical particles in your lab.  Monitor to ensure there is no direct exposure to the compounder.  par
